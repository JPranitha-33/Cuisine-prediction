CUSINE PREDICTION 
Build a model to learn the Cuisine type based on Training data set and Predict the type of Cuisine for each recipe ID in the Test data
PRE-REQUISITES
Google – CoLab , R
METHODOLOGY :
DATA – PREPROCESSING
VECTORIZATION
As a part of data cleaning process , the strings has been trimmed , the text document has been converted into the matrix of token counts .
The Categorical features are encoded using one – hot coding  and a document matrix has been computed 
EXPLORATARY ANALYSIS :
Exploratory data analysis has been done with Histogram

EVALUATION METRIC :
Multi-class Accuracy 
The NLP has been done using Bag of words with 2 gram 
        Logistic Regression 
 Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that fits a number of decision trees classifier. 

RESULTS:
Random forest sign data with Accuracy 99 %
       Logistic Regression 2- gram with Accuracy 86 %
